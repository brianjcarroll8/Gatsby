## Background

The [WAVE tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) is an entire suite of accessibility evaluation tools but we are going to focus on the browser extensions, which are available for Chrome and Firefox. These tools are created by [Web Accessibility in Mind (Web AIM)](https://webaim.org/), who are responsible for creating a whole host of amazing resources, tools, and projects that enable people to make accessible web content.

It is built on an API that tracks a [long list of possible accessibility violations](https://wave.webaim.org/api/docs?format=html) that would be evident from looking at a page's HTML and CSS.

We'll use it to verify semantic structure, validate color contrast, and double check any ARIA on the page.

## Functionality

To use the WAVE tool, you can click the browser extension icon or use the keyboard shortcut (`Command + Shift + U` for Mac, `Control + Shift + U` for Windows).

### Automated Audit

As soon as you click the extension icon or enter the shortcut, WAVE runs an automatic audit on the page and opens a sidebar with information. You'll notice that it adds icons to the page with CSS that allow you to visually identify errors, warnings, and features and get more information about them, scoped to the element. If you find the added icons distracting, you can toggle them off with the "Styles" toggle in the WAVE sidebar.

The sidebar defaults to showing a summary of the audit. This shows counts for each of its categories. Right away you'll be able to tell if the page has no accessibility errors, whether it uses any ARIA, and how complex the page's structure is.

### Details

If you view the details, you'll see a full list of categories and elements that fall into them. So if your site had 3 errors and 10 contrast errors, you'll see each of them in detail listed out. If you click on any item icons in the details list your focus will be directed to where that element is on the page. Additionally if you click the info icon, a longer description of the item will appear in the "reference" tab of the sidebar.

- Errors: These are issues that are mark failure to satisfy WCAG requirements.
- Contrast Errors: These are issues where text does not meet WCAG color contrast requirements.
- Alerts: These highlight elements that _may_ cause issues for users. This is where we start getting into the neccessity for manual testing, as you have to use your judgement to decide whether an actual issue exists.
- Features:
- Structural Elements
- ARIA

## Exercise

Let's use the WAVE tool to verify that this page [PICK A PAGE] is structurally sound.

## Wrap-up

We're starting to scratch the surface of how important manual testing is in determining whether a site is accessible.
