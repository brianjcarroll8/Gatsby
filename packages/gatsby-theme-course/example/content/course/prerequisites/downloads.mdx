## Downloads

No matter what platform you are on, you'll need:

1. A browser with extensions that let you do automated testing and audits
2. A screen reader
3. The browser that is most frequently used with that screen reader

For number 1, I'm going to recommend that we use Google Chrome since it allows us to use what is (in my opinion) the most full-featured browser extension, Microsoft's [Accessiblility Insights](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-insights-fo/pbjjkligggfmakdaogkfomddhfmpjeni).
Please ensure you have [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) installed and then make sure you add the [Accessibility Insights](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-insights-fo/pbjjkligggfmakdaogkfomddhfmpjeni) and [WAVE tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) extensions to Chrome.

You might be wondering why I'm recommending that you test in two different browsers. While I do most of my personal development and testing in Chrome, and it has great tools, it is not the most often used browser for screen readers. So we want to make sure that we have a browser we use specifically for screen reader testing. This means that we'll catch bugs that show up for the largest group of useres and also encourages us to do cross-browser testing, which is generally good practice anyway.

### Mac

Apple has worked really hard to make sure that its platform is accessible. This means that it has a top-notch screen reader built right in!
You can press `cmd+F5` to activate VoiceOver and use the same shortcut to turn it off.
Because VoiceOver is an Apple tool, it works best with Safari, and that is the [screen reader/browser combination](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/#browsercombos) most often seen on Macs.
These are pre-installed so you won't have to do anything extra to get going!

### Windows

The most commonly used screen reader on Windows is [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/), which is open source and free!
Please make sure you have [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) installed on your machine. Additionally, NVDA is most often used with [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox), so you'll need that too.
